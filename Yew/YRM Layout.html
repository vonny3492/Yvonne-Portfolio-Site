<h1>Catalog Layout</h1>
<p>I decided it would be interesting to do a look book of the fashion in the many colleges at the University of Minnesota: Twin Cities, using my friends as examples. I took inspiration from Modcloth.com as well as the website Lookbook.com. The assignment was to create a catalog that consisted of multiple images and lots of text.</p>
<p>
I used a background design that included a woven pattern which connects to the idea that clothes are all essentially woven, I also included a piece of "thread" that is more whimsical and thins out to add variety the composition but still ties into the theme. I used the University of Minnesota colors because my look book is of college students here at the U. I thought it would also add variety to have the weave be more dense behind the images of the individual clothes. 
</p>
<p>
I chose two fonts, one which was simple and and had a diverse selection of styles and then a unique font that was more eccentric and unique. The look book theme is somewhat unique, and the clothes a bit eccentric or at least eclectic, so I thought the font would fit. I also made my descriptions somewhat comical, so that made the font fit too.

<p class="two">The layout I used included the same background for each interior page, which was a variation of the front cover. I had one large picture of the model/student on the left with the name of their college, and the 3 items on the right with a description of the person and the clothes.</p>
