<h1>Redesigned Book Cover</h1>
<p>The book I chose, is a compilation of old folktales from Norway; there is a specific theme of trolls. Trolls in Norway, according to the author (Lise Lunge-Larsen), were a source of fear for children, as well as the characters in many tales of morality.</p>
<p>
In my design I wanted to capture the beauty and darkness that is present in Norwegian Folktales. I wanted to reference Norway in more than just the images (those are Norwegian mountains), I also created a border that used red, blue and white, which are the colors in the Norwegian flag. This border also is designed similarly to Viking and Norse carvings and art pieces. I wanted to reference Norway many times since this book is targeted towards young Norwegians, or at least children with Norwegian ancestry.</p>
<p>
I used Photoshop to create the background of a troll climbing the mountains at sunset. I used filters, masks, and adjustment layers inorder to create the illusion. I also used Illustrator to create the border and the words, as well as the heart shaped hole in the trolls body. This I did using the pen tool, brushes and gradients.</p>

<p class="two">Folktale and fairy tale books are illustrated and I wanted to showcase that in the cover so I added trees and mountains into the words of the title.</p>
