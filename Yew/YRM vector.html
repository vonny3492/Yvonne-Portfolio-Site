<h1>Social Issues Poster</h1>
<p>Adoption is an issue which is important and most people agree on that. However, far too few people actually participate in adoption, be it domestic or international. According to Children's Home Society & Family Services over 150 million children are orphaned or abandoned. With my poster, I hoped to encourage adoption of international children, but I wanted to keep the poster non-specific enough that parents looking to adopt domestic children also feel encouraged to adopt. I also tried to specify that this poster was for a specific organization: Children's Home Society & Family Services.</p>
<p>CHSFS is a not for profit organization with involvement in adoption, foster care, early childhood care and education, and child and family support. They repeat their slogan multiple times throughout their website and that is: "We believe that every child has a fundamental right to security, opportunity, permanency and a loving family". I wanted to include this in my poster.</p>
<p>The imagery I chose to use, a mother holding up her child, I thought would portray the metaphor of lifting children from their misfortune into a more happy and secure life; from the dirt to the sun. I also highlighted the baby, as well as reinforcing the metaphor of lifting the child into the sun, by putting a glowing circle as well as a star behind it. I used simple illustration and matte colors, with only outlines in shades of the color, to seperate the different pieces.</p>
