					<h3>I'm a user experience designer with a strong research and web focus.</h3>
					
					<p>Through my career, I’ve gained professional experience in a variety of unique industries. From health care to history, I've learned to design with the user in mind while working within the constraints particular to every situation.</p>
					
					<p>I'm passionate about problem solving in ways that work best for everyone. I think usability research and establishing visual hiearchy are key to great design.</p>
